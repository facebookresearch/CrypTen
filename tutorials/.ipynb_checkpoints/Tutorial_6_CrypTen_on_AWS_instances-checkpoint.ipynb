    "# CrypTen on AWS Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous tutorials have covered the essentials of using CrypTen on our local machines. We also provides a script `aws_launcher.py` in the `scripts` directory that will allow you to compute on encrypted data on multiple AWS instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Alice has a classifier on one AWS instance and Bob has data on another AWS instance, `aws_launcher.py` will allow Alice and Bob to classify the data without revealing their respective private information (just as we did in Tutorial 4). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the Launcher Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to follow are:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> First, create multiple AWS instances with public AMI \"Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 24.0\", and record the instance IDs. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Install PyTorch, CrypTen and dependencies of the program to be run on all AWS instances.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Run `aws_launcher.py` on your local machine, as we explain below.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "The results are left on the AWS instances. Log messages will be printed on your local machine by launcher script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Run\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell shows a sample usage of the `aws_launcher.py` script. Note, however, that the command in the cell will not work as is: please replace the parameters used with appropriate ones with your own AWS instances, usernames, and `.ssh` keys (see documentation in the `aws_launcher.py` script).
