Here, Alice has a pre-trained model that cannot be revealed, while Bob would like to use this model to evaluate on private data sample(s). This scenario can occur when a pre-trained model is proprietary or contains sensitive information, but can provide value to other parties with sensitive data.\n",

Instead, we will demonstrate this example by encrypting the true model parameters (`w_true` and `b_true`) from Alice and encrypting the test set from Bob for evaluation.\n",
