    "\n",
    "As we did with CrypTensors in Tutorial 3, we will use CrypTen's load functionality (i.e., `crypten.load`) to read a model from file to a particular source. The source is indicated by the keyword argument `src`. As in Tutorial 3, this src argument tells us the rank of the party we want to load the model to (and later, encrypt the model from). In addition, here we also need to provide a dummy model to tell CrypTen the model's structure. The dummy model is indicated by the keyword argument `dummy_model`. Note that unlike loading a tensor, the result from `crypten.load` is not encrypted. Instead, only the `src` party's model is populated from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is loaded, we call the function `from_pytorch`: this function sets up a CrypTen network from the PyTorch network. It takes the plaintext network as input as well as dummy input. The dummy input must be a `torch` tensor of the same shape as a potential input to the network, however the values inside the tensor do not matter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we call `encrypt` on the CrypTen network to encrypt its parameters. Once we call the `encrypt` function, the models `encrypted` property will verify that the model parameters have been encrypted. (Encrypted CrypTen networks can also be decrypted using the `decrypt` function)."
