That is, let's say Alice has a trained model she wishes to keep private, and Bob has some data he wishes to classify while keeping it private. We'll see how CrypTen allows Alice and Bob to coordinate and classify the data, while achieving their privacy requirements.\n",

Then, we call `encrypt` on the CrypTen network to encrypt its parameters. After encryption, the CrypTen network can also decrypted (see the `decrypt` function).\n",

    "In addition to the PyTorch network, the `from_pytorch` function also requires a dummy input of the shape of the model's input. The dummy input simply needs to be a `torch` tensor of the same shape; the values inside the tensor do not matter. (This is a requirement of `torch.distributed`, our communication backend.) After calling the `encrypt` function, we'll be able to check that the model is encrypted. (We won't actually look into how the model is encrypted in this tutorial; we'll leave that to Tutorial 5). \n",
