    "\n",
    "We now have a high-level understanding of how secure MPC works. Through these tutorials, we will explain how to use CrypTen to carry out secure operations on encrypted tensors. In this tutorial, we will introduce a fundamental building block in CrypTen, called a ```CrypTensor```.  ```CrypTensor```s are encrypted ```torch``` tensors that can be used for computing securely on data. \n",

    "CrypTen currently only supports secure MPC protocols (though we intend to add support for other advanced encryption protocols). Using the ```mpc``` backend, ```CrypTensor```s act as ```torch``` tensors whose values are encrypted using secure MPC protocols. Tensors created using the ```mpc``` backend are called ```MPCTensor```s. We will go into greater detail about ```MPCTensors``` in Tutorial 2. \n",
