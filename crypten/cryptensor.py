        - If both tensors are 1-dimensional, the dot product (scalar) is returned.
        - If both arguments are 2-dimensional, the matrix-matrix product is returned.
        - If the first argument is 1-dimensional and the second argument is
          2-dimensional, a 1 is prepended to its dimension for the purpose of
          the matrix multiply. After the matrix multiply, the
          prepended dimension is removed.
        - If the first argument is 2-dimensional and the second argument is 1-dimensional,
          the matrix-vector product is returned.
        - If both arguments are at least 1-dimensional and at least one argument
          is N-dimensional (where N > 2), then a batched matrix multiply is returned.
          If the first argument is 1-dimensional, a 1 is prepended to its dimension
